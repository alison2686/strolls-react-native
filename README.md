# strolls-react-native

This app was created for the Girl Develop It Hackathon 2022.

The goal is to provide a service for wellness and health through encouraging users to walk in order to achieve their fitness goals and to explore different routes. In general, this application allows for the user to pick a location and then randomizes and area to explore around that location. In addition, the users can share pictures of the amazing sights and places they found on their paths, this, to invite others to explore this new found gems and to have a visual reminder of all the adventures and places conquered, which as result, will help them with accountability and inspiration.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
To develop applications with Expo, you need two tools. A command-line tool called Expo CLI to serve your project, and a mobile client app called Expo Go to open the project on Android and iOS platforms. Additionally, you can use any web browser to run the project on the web.

[Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) a command-line tool that is the primary interface between a developer and other Expo tools.

[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) client app (Android or iOS) or use a Android and/or iOS simulator.

[React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) Routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps.

Installing dependencies into an Expo managed projectâ€‹
In your project directory, run: ```npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context```

[Bottom Tabs Navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/) A simple tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between different routes. Routes are lazily initialized -- their screen components are not mounted until they are first focused.



## Installation

```npm start```
Then scan the QR code on Expo Go to open the app
